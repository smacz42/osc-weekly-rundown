# [CAB requires all CAs to check and process a domain's CAA before issuing certs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_Certification_Authority_Authorization)
* Certification Authority Authorization
  * [RFC 6844](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6844) standardized in 2013
  * New DNS Record (type 257)
    * Can list zero by specifying `":"`
    * Comma-separated otherwise
  * Lists CAs that are authorized to provide certs for domain 
  * Therefore it acts as a whitelist (good!)
  * Intended to strengthen PKI
    * Similar to public key pinning (HPKP)
  *  CAA record checking takes about 7ms per record
  * CAA record creation is possible in the latest version of BIND, NSD, Knot, and PowerDNS.
  * Intended to stop
* CAB
  * "A voluntary consortium of certification authorities, vendors of Internet browser software, operating systems, and other PKI-enabled applications that promulgates industry guidelines governing the issuance and management of X.509 v.3 digital certificates that chain to a trust anchor embedded in such applications."
  * [CA/Browser Forum](https://cabforum.org/)
* CAA is largely an administrative control.
  * Enterprises can utilize CAA to force their organization into a uniform issuance policy that’s enforced by the CAs.
* [SSL Labs already supports checking for CAA](https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan/issues/274)
* Clients can not force a CAA check to verify a certificate
  * "Relying Applications MUST NOT use CAA records as part of certificate validation"
  * "CAA records are intended to allow CAs to avoid mis-issuing certificates in some circumstances, while DANE records are intended to allow relying applications (TLS clients) to avoid relying on mis-issued certificates in some circumstances."
* Proposal implementation
  * Proposal passed - March 2017
  * Proposal implement date - September 2017

# [Someone hacked every tornado siren in Dallas. It was loud](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C83bG_1UIAAiU4v.jpg)
* Friday, April 8, 2017
* 18 minutes before midnight
* For _an hour and a half_
* 156 emergency weather sirens
* [Map of siren locations](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C86cHfnUMAAWKkV.jpg)
* "Flummoxed officials had decided the only way to stop the noise was 'to unplug the radio systems and the repeater, and pretty much turn the siren system completely off.” 
* Officials have ruled out a remote hack
  * All indicators point to [HACKERMAN](http://i.imgur.com/BMSSPFJ.jpg)
* Storms are expected to roll into the region next week
